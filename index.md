## Bio
**Yun-Chen Lo** (Jason) is currently pursuing his master degree at EE Department, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.  His research interest includes Computer Architecture, more specifically includes **HW/SW co-design and accelerator design for convolutional neural networks**.  He publishes 4 papers, two of the papers won **silver award** of ACM **Student Research Competition at MICRO 2018 and 2019**, respectively. In addition, He completes **2 functioning chip Tape-outs**.

He is currently a member of System and Storage Design Lab (advised by [Prof. Ren-Shuo Liu](https://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/renshuo/)). He also attends [ENIAC team](https://eniac.ee.nthu.edu.tw/index.html) (Co-advised by [Prof. Ren-Shuo Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KEshqdcAAAAJ), [Prof. Meng-Fan Chang](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=7rcOEiIAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW), [Prof. Chih-Cheng Hsieh](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=eBnwkkQAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW), [Prof. Kea-Tiong Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DiSis28AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Chung-Chuan Lo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zULxPHYAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW)) to conduct reseaches including neuromorphic computing, computing in memory (CIM), computing in sensor (CIS) and flexible deep learning architecture design.
